# Website Implementation: Girl Code Australia

Girl Code Australia aims to inspire female secondary students to pursue a career in computer science, information technology and software engineering. Girl Code Australia seeks to educate and empower females with the essential skills, knowledge and confidence to thrive in technology-related industries. 

As the Founder of Girl Code Australia, I am passionate about empowering and supporting females in technology, starting from secondary school through to working in industry. Girl Code Australia currently has an active LinkedIn and Instagram and so naturally the next step is designing a website.


## Structure

Girl Code Australia features a relatively flat hierarchal structure for the website, consisting of five pages, each serving a unique purpose,
